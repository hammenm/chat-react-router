# MewoGPT react-router

This project is the final exercise project for the React course.

To start the project, you need first to launch the server:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run db:init
npm run start
```

Don't forget to use a `.env` file. You can copy `.env.example` to `.env`

Then you can start the client part:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
